  <h1>Personal Background</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Kassie, and I am the creator of Project Gojo. To learn more about me, 
    here is a link to my <a href="https://gkassie.github.io/" target="blank">personal website</a>.</p>
  <p>This website will expose you to a cultural critique of Gojo Ethiopian Restaurant with multiple
    sub-topics to explore. Along the way you will be exposed to Ethiopia.</p>

  <h1>Restaurant Background</h1>
  <p>Gojo Ethiopian Restaurant is a vibrant and traditional Ethiopian restaurant family owned by a couple 
    that immigrated from Ethiopia. Gojo means house in Amharic, Ethiopia’s main language, and usually 
    consists of mud and straw houses. A gojo symbolizes families and people coming together and enjoying 
    time together. </p>
  <p>This restaurant is located in Phoenix, AZ, and uses spices imported from Ethiopia. Ethiopian cuisine 
    consists of “vegetable and spicy meat dishes served on top of injera, a large flat bread made out of 
    fermented teff flour” (<a href="https://www.gojoethrestaurant.com/about_us" target="blank">Gojo</a>). This cuisine is typically eaten with your right hand and replaces 
    utensils with your right hand that picks up injera and scoops the entrees and places them into your mouth.</p>

    <h1>Food Overview</h1>
    <p>The food was really flavorful and wonderfully prepared. I ordered to go and went 
        to the restaurant to pick it up. We ordered 4 dishes: Doro Wat, Kitfo, FirFir, 
        and a Veggie Combo. A link to the menu on their website can be found 
        <a href="https://www.gojoethrestaurant.com/entrees" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Food Review</h1>
    <p>The food was really good, and I enjoyed sharing it with my family while getting 
        a taste of everything. The meal was a lot of food, and we had a little leftover 
        as well. The food was really good and used traditional spices and ingredients like 
        onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, butter, berbere, and mitmita. The doro wat was properly 
        served with chicken legs and an egg smothered in the delicious wat, consisting of 
        simmering berbere and onions. The kitfo was flavorful and was prepared with meat and 
        butter. The FirFir was simple but tasty and consists of injera and butter with a 
        combination of tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. The veggie combo was a nice sample 
        of a variety of dishes with a multitude of vegetables.

    <h1>Globalization</h1>
    <p>This restaurant offered certain combinations of entrees labeled as combos. This appeals 
        to Americans because it allows people to try a variety of different entrees but in smaller 
        portions. If families chose to dine here, there would be something for everyone. For example, 
        if a family chooses a Gojo Combo for only $17.99, they would get a combination of a meat combo, 
        a veggie combo, and a side of tibs. A variety of food is attractive to Americans and is similar 
        to a buffet.</p>

    <h1>Adaption</h1>
    <p>However, some of the ingredients used to prepare the food might have been adapted to American culture. 
        For instance, it is common for Ethiopian restaurants in America to mix flour with teff to make injera. 
        Another scenario is using cheaper oils like sunflower or canola instead of 100% pure extra virgin 
        olive oil. But most of the dishes on the menu are authentic and use proper names to distinguish them.</p>
